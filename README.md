Scottish Ruby Conference 2010 Video Download Script
============================================

A little bit late I know, but I only just got round to watching the SRC2010 presentations and they're a pain in the arse to download manually so I wrote this little script and thought I'd share.

Also over at the [Spoonfed Media](http://www.spoonfed.co.uk) mansion, Islington, London, the [Bullseyehub.com](http://www.bullseyehub.com) dev team will be doing a few screening events of the SCR 2010 and 2011 (when they're released) with at least some free beers to be had, watch this space.
